# FCC-Quote-Compiler
I didn't like that a lot of the quotes in the Random Quote Machine project in Free Code Camp were by racists, rapists, and classists, so I made a python script to compile a raw quote text file into a json file.

To use this script, simply add or replace lines in the "raw quotes.txt" file before running jsonCompiler.py. Lines should alternate between quotes and their authors.

Extra whitespace should not be used, as the script does not ignore empty lines. The script will create a file, "quotes.json" with proper json formatting and indenting. No fuss, no muss. Running the script WILL overwrite any previous iteration of quotes.json.
